# The Demise of Vanity Metrics: A Reflective Study

## Overview
This repository contains a reflective study examining the thirty-year evolution of marketing measurement and the imperative for its transformation into a data science discipline.

## Abstract
This study critically analyses the historical drift of marketing measurement from its direct response foundations to contemporary reliance on opaque analytics and vanity metrics. It argues that the rise of AI-driven search represents an existential paradigm shift, rendering traditional KPIs obsolete. Through historical analysis and conceptual critique, the study concludes that marketing's only sustainable future lies in its reconstitution as a data science discipline, built on forecasting, causal inference, and probabilistic reasoning.

## Key Themes
- Historical analysis of marketing measurement from direct response to digital era
- Critical evaluation of mainstream analytics platforms (Google Analytics, Search Console)
- The impact of AI and Large Language Models on search and user intent
- The data science gap in contemporary marketing practice
- A proposed framework for scientific marketing in the AI age
